Welcome to my personal projects portfolio, here I will showcase what I've worked on in Python in my own time. I'm passionate about data science and eager to land a role enabling me to apply and strengthen my knowledge and skills.

Project 1 (Population Pyramid) :
  This project involved making use of publicly available data from the 2021 census to create a population pyramid showing the distributoin of male and female age groups. 

Project 2(Multilinear Regression):
  This project involved using second hand car data from Kaggle to fit a multi linear regression model, enabling to make predictions for the car price given an entered set of parameters.
