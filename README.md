Welcome to my personal projects portfolio, here I will showcase what I've worked on in Python in my own time. I'm passionate about data science and eager to apply and strengthen these skills further. 

Project 1 (Population Pyramid) :
  This project involved making use of publicly available data from the 2021 census to create a population pyramid showing the distribution of male and female age groups in England and Wales. I also attempted a curve fit for the historical population trend of England and Wales, to enable making predictions for the population in the future.

Project 2 (Car price prediction):
  This project involved using second hand car data from Kaggle to fit a multi linear regression model, enabling to make predictions for the car price given an entered set of parameters.

Project 3 (Diabetes prediction):
  This project involved using a diabetes dataset from Kaggle to fit a logistic regression and random forest model, enabling to make a prediction for if a patient is diabetic.
