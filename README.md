Welcome to my personal projects portfolio, here I will showcase what I've worked on in Python in my own time. I'm passionate about data science and eager to apply and strengthen these skills further.

# PROJECT 2 (Population Pyramid) 
  This project involved making use of publicly available data from the 2021 census to create a population pyramid showing the distribution of male and female age groups in England and Wales. I also attempted a curve fit for the historical population trend of England and Wales, to enable making predictions for the population in the future.
